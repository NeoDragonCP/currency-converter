# About
I created this currency converter for practice and a bit of fun.
It connects to an external API for fetching the currencies, then trims down the currency code and uses an exteneral link to display the flag for the currency, and uses ES6 Map and Set to store the currency symbols.

This is also my first project using Github Actions for CD/CI for the Gh-Page. On update to the master branch, the code will rebuild the GH pages build/branch.

Uses Styled Commponents.
Includes Dark theme toggle ;)
